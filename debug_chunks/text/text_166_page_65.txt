Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows: (In millions, except earnings per share) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 72,361 $ 72,738 $ 61,271 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 7,446 7,496 7,547 Dilutive effect of stock-based awards 26 44 61 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 7,472 7,540 7,608 Earnings Per Share Basic (A/B) $ 9.72 $ 9.70 $ 8.12 Diluted (A/C) $ 9.68 $ 9.65 $ 8.05 Anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods presented. 64
